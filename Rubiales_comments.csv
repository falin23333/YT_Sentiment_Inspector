180,"There was a similar incident - fully non-consensual - after Spain&#39;s win at the 2010 World Cup. It involved Goalkeeper (and captain [?]) Iker Casillas and his then girl-friend - in her day job as a journalist - tasked to get access to him for the first interview after the win. He kind of waved a finger at the question while looking at her with a bedroom level of intensity, pulled her in and left her properly flustered with a raw kiss.  <br>Spain is different but not necessarily in a bad way. My only visit to Spain was a long weekend in Barcelona back in the Noughties. A feature that struck me was the sight of these guys who  probably only made 5&#39;5&quot; before breakfast in the morning walking around clubs with the quiet masculine assurance I more readily associated with a heavyweight boxer strolling along the street. That phenomenon gave me insight for the first time how most of Central and South America came to be Spanish speaking: these boys are real men. Men only become &#39;men&#39; because the women around them nurture them in that way. It is a virtuous circle as well because central to the self-identity of such men is a cherishing of their women which is a precious and priceless thing: like love in a relationship, you only miss it when it has gone but it has gone, it&#39;s gone for good. <br>Spain is in danger of throwing out a very healthy baby with the bathwater here (and lightly-soiled bathwater at that). Spanish culture is Spanish society&#39;s greatest resource: despite facing the juggernaut of self-belief allied with high technical skills and physicality that the England womens&#39; team has become over the past couple of years, the thinking people in the UK kind of knew the Spanish girls would win last Sunday. Just like we knew that Spain would win back in 2010. Only a fundamentally healthy national culture is capable of consistently carrying nationals to these heights. Consider also the very rise to the top of the Spanish women&#39;s team; when the men won in 2010, the women&#39;s team was barely second-raters, never having even qualified for a World Cup. I think they first qualified in 2015, MAKING THIS ONLY THEIR THIRD APPEARANCE!. The way of &#39;Woke&#39; is the way of loss of certainty.

Rubiales also failed to assess the potentials for Jenni to feel uncomfortable. She later joked in the locker room that she did not like the kiss, but she did not sound like she cared this much about what happened (in the video she is clearly laughing out of what happened). I think that the media and the society made a huge case out of this, to the point that now even Jenni is coming out with an harsher version of the situation. Again, the problems did not start because Jenni&#39;s celebration was ruined by this incident, but rather because the media and the society decided to make a monumental issue out of this objectively marginal incident.

It‚Äôs happened throughout history of sports where people get overjoyed and celebrating and just hug or kiss in celebration. This is not a sexual assault. It was like it was a long drawn out Kiss, or he tried to go further, he just gave her a kiss. She was still laughing and cheering afterward. And then later when her manager and publicists got ahold of her and said this could be huge she then came out with it being sexual assault. But it‚Äôs just a peck kiss. He didn‚Äôt grab her ass while he did it, he didn‚Äôt make out with her he just in a moment of joy and extreme delight got caught up in the moment and gave her a kiss like he probably would anyone. Again Spanish people are very lovey dovey and give loads of kisses to each other. This shouldn‚Äôt be news, he shouldn‚Äôt be forced to step down.

She said she was uncomfortable she didn‚Äôt say exactly to what and In detail because I would feel very similar also if a coach or owner who never shows that much love and affection and emotions is going around hugging and swinging people around and full grabbing heads like she is his daughter like yea I would be uncomfortable as well if my own dad did it because it was out of character for him and a shock to his normal demeanor. He should obviously apologize to her if she felt offended but I‚Äôm trying to give him the benefit of his words and say as a man who‚Äôs married as much as love my wife I would never kiss her or anybody I‚Äôm attracted to like this cause it‚Äôs just weird looking.

Someone grabbed me, and gave me a big smootch, when a happy news was announced. These were ladies, and I was so shokked, cos it was in very serious work environment, the other happened in front of my family. Oh yes, it happened once in church as well, by a friend, in front of her husband, who is very Conservative. I really don&#39;t think much of this, although I don&#39;t know, but to me it seems that only the innocent extreme pure joy overtook this man, and he didn&#39;t even realise it. I feel for him. We judge him before we asked him. Of course I would hate this to happen to my husband, but this act can really be just joy overtaken the person, and no motive behind it.

What is the only book or words ever uttered or written down from since before our time that have we as a whole seen come true?  <br>Matthew 24:32 ‚ÄúNow learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh.  33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.<br>     And what does this parable tell us in its highest level of understanding?  That Israel will become a nation again.  And that the harvest, (the final season for this wicked world) is even at the door (upon us).<br>     Who was it that said these words?<br>Wasn&#39;t it God himself?  God who came to visit us on the earth in 7BC-33AD.  <br>And in a very picturesque and eloquent way of speaking.  <br>Through the nation of Israel.  A nation that rejected God himself.   Just like the historic parable of the wicked Israelites that returned to Jerusalem just to die in the land of Egypt contrary to God&#39;s constant forgiveness.  Israel today has returned to its land of Israel only to once again deny the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the words of the one thing that all Israel believes in. and that of prophecy come true. <br>Who&#39;s words prophesied that the branch would bear leaf again? <br>     This time the Messiah has returned as the great potentate.  The highest law officer in all creation.  The Judge of mankind.  And when mankind is judged then the proof of the judge&#39;s credentials must be presented.  <br>Mine are the very words of the Lord Jesus Christ.  That&#39;s whose words came true for all the world to see.  For all generations before the end.  Yes, you and me and our parents and sons and daughters.<br>     This is an everlasting judgment no one is without the high court of God.  His judgments are right and just, merciful and compassionate.   Israel of today is as dead as the Israelites who ran away from God into Egypt.  <br>Jeremiah 44:12      And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration and an astonishment, and a curse and a reproach.<br>This Israel has run away from God once again to the new Egypt.  It may as well be a new Egypt, as judgment is upon all the nations of the world and upon all people, and creation itself.  And are no closer to the sons and daughters of God as they were in 33 AD. <br>Jeremiah 44:12 is a real time walking live breathing historical parable that describes all of the world.  God gave us so much time to turn from our wickedness.  It&#39;s too late. <br>Just like the world over starting with the churches in 1988.  It&#39;s too late.<br>      Who&#39;s words are the only words that we as mankind cannot deny over all of our theories.   our infactactuation of Luck, our ignorance swayed by coincidence?   God scoffs at that.  <br>Psalm 2:4  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall hold them in derision.  That&#39;s God&#39;s judgment up to mankind.  It&#39;s too late.  <br>      The jury (the prophets of the Bible) is in and guilty is the verdict. <br>The Judge God and author of the Bible finds mankind must pay the penalty of death everlasting. <br>And to those who wear white robes with palms in their hands, there is life everlasting.  The dye is set and ink and paper of the Book never lie. <br>     It&#39;s too late for a divorced adultress whom God has no obligation to defend  (the nation of Israel and the churches and the nations of the world) as God sees all sinners alike.<br>It&#39;s too late for the entire world.  The book of Jeremiah was written to all the nations and is alive and as sure today in the day of the harvest as it was in the day of unleavened bread. <br>This goes much deeper and deserves a closer look.  <br>The world, every man, woman, and child must now ask the question:   <br>Who said Israel would become a worldly (gentile) nation again?

Unfortunately, most of us have deviated from the guidance that our Creator gave us for a peaceful and satisfied life. It‚Äôs never too late. God loves those who comeback to Him. God (Allah) is the most forgiving and most merciful.  His Grace is waiting for you and for everyone.<br>Time to time God sent His prophets and messengers in order to reinforce and remind His guidance.

Thousands of prophets and messengers came towards humanity including Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, Joseph, David, Solomon, Moses, Shoaib, Saleh, Zachariah, Jesus Christ and Muhammad (peace be upon all of them). They all gave SINGLE and the same message;<br>God (Allah) must be worshiped alone (without any partners) and people must fulfill their obligations (rights and responsibilities) to each other.<br>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final and last messenger of God (Allah) upon whom Allah completed His guidance for the rest of the humanity. The last messenger of Allah (God); Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a universal prophet. God made him the messenger for all human beings. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is NOT a prophet for Muslims only. He is the prophet of Allah for all humanity.<br>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born more than fourteen centuries ago in Makkah. He was the most kind and merciful messenger of Allah. He established justice and peace for all human beings.

Righteousness belongs to heart, not in the appearance<br>Ensure to fulfill your responsibilities towards your Creator<br>Ensure to fulfill your responsibilities towards parents, wife, children, relatives, neighbours and fellow human beings.<br> Allah gave Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) the divine guidance in the form of a book. This book is called Qur‚Äôan.  Qur‚Äôan verifies other divine books such as Torah, Gospel, etc‚Ä¶ Qur‚Äôan explains the beliefs of believers and warns about the dangers of ignorance and arrogance. Qur‚Äôan gives us the news of past present and future.<br>The way of life that Allah prescribed for all human beings is called ISLAM.  Islam is a common sense and natural way of life. It has no illogical beliefs. Islam is very scientific and has no ambiguities. It is a pure way of life. Islam provides peace of heart and mind. Islam protects environment, dignity and respect for all human beings. Islam removes all false claims of superiority based upon gender, ethnicity, colour, language, wealth, fame, power, vanity, etc‚Ä¶. Islam very strongly condemns racism, discrimination, hate, oppression, violence, terrorism, extremism, fanaticism, etc.<br>Islam protects the rights of children, women, elderly, rich and poor.   Islam connects human beings to their Lord for eternal peace and harmony.<br>I invite you towards peace, Islam<br>If you are interested in finding out more about Islam, please call me or send me an email.

So, keep your mouth to yourself unless you‚Äôve been given permission to touch any part of my body. Ladies, if you don‚Äôt want that kiss, put your hand between your lips and other person‚Äôs lips.

Many people get embarrassed so fast.

19,"He apologies to everyone but the player.  Something extremely wrong there.  Forcefully holding their head during the kiss,  offering no out for the player,  is effectively bullying.  Intentionally or otherwise.  It&#39;s inappropriate conduct.  Not CEO material.  It&#39;s forced intimate behaviour,  even if spur of the moment,  it&#39;s inappropriate conduct,  as it wasn&#39;t consensual.  In the state of NSW Australia,  where it occurred it&#39;s considered non consensual sexual touching in legal terms.  He should be sacked ( not just because of the incident itself ) but,  also because he keeps lying and denying.  The players account contradicts his account and the video speaks for itself.  The player says in a separate video that it wasn&#39;t consensual and that she didn&#39;t enjoy it.  She explains that he grabbed her like this,  when demonstrating how he held her for the kiss. The president said afterward that he feels embarrassed.  That means he realises what he did was inappropriate.  In the dressing room after the games she says she disliked him kissing her. i.e. &quot;but I didn&#39;t like it&quot; , then she said &quot;but what do I do?&quot;  It&#39;s pretty much an open and shut case of unwanted intimate attention.",0,0

48,"What a ridiculous little man. He doesn&#39;t understand that he did something terrible. A kiss is never just a kiss, it is physical contact with the mouth. The kiss is primarily an expression of love and caring; FREQUENTLY IT IS ALSO A PART OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY. No one has the right to touch another person&#39;s body without their express permission. When the ‚Äúboss‚Äù kisses his ‚Äúemployee‚Äù on the mouth, it is basically an assault because he is her employer and pays her salary. Due to this dependency, she is not completely free to say honestly whether she wants to be kissed or not. So it&#39;s fundamentally non-consensual, regardless of whether he should have asked and she should have said yes (assuming it was at all like he now claims). By the way, she also said: &quot;I didn&#39;t like it&quot; and &quot;What should I have done?&quot;. In addition there is the absolute exceptional situation, the element of surprise and the fact that everything happened in a few seconds. She had no time at all to react to his kissing-ATTACK, her head clamped between his hands like in a vise. More and more &quot;strange&quot; things are coming to light about this &quot;gentleman&quot;. This man does not have the psychological or emotional maturity to fill this position.

59,"I don&#39;t think it was a sex thing, more like euphoria, they had just won the world cup and she scored the winning goal. You do sometimes see men doing the same on the pitch, not common but I have seen it a few times over the years. Seems rather harsh to me in isolation but perhaps the other complaints are valid.",21,0

73,"This is not about football. It is about personal executive public conduct. (Call it EPC say). A licence should be held at all times.  Applies to anyone who stands in front of a public audience of any size for any purpose at any time planned or not. It is a personal skill, innate and honed. <br><br>I consider that any executive with public duties should be qualified to hold office position. That would also contain the clear ability to override self interest and ego with an understanding of the organisation they represent. Resignation is a skill to be exercised with dignity, wisdom and critical presentational skill. <br><br>This man has none of these qualities. There are questions in the media. In light of this, he should be advised of his duty of care. And given the opportunity to resign. Should he fail, he should be given personal advice of the likely personal cost for his future. Ego is a pig of a problem. Needs treatment. Usually some months and then re-testing. Like a drivers licence. He can then present himself for further public duties. Or fail. He must hold a licence.",16,0

75,"This is interesting.... on the surface, it&#39;s such a common thing that happens between male players practically every time they score a goal let alone win the World Cup but you then add the opposite sex into the equation, and it instantly becomes sexualised. The safest answer, for men, is to not speak with, look at, interact with and certainly not touch women in any way, basically pretend they don&#39;t exist unless you&#39;re spoken to first......just leave &#39;em alone guys!",1,0
